# Submission Status Button

This button was originally produced by [Tamino Martinius](https://codepen.io/Zaku/pen/fDIvb). All original styling and animation has been left as is, and the button was turned into a reusable web component via [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/).

## Contributing

Please feel free to update and modify the component in any way.
